# LearningReactBitbyBit
It's a repository I use to store my practice while learning egg head react free lessons: https://egghead.io/courses/react-fundamentals . I found it useful so I hope you do, too. :)

#Steps:

1. Start a react app using facebook incubator
Please check the detailed steps of how to do it here
https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app

2. Add all the AppXXX.js file under the src folder

3. For trying out different app, make a copy of Appxxx.js into the App folder and re-name it as App.js

4. Change the directory of import App from "./App.js" into "./App/App.js"
